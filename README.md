# Equitable-s-p-edge-colorings-of-K_n-with-embeddings
This repository contains extensive examples of equitable (s,p) edge colorings of K_n with .png files and .txt to show both the image and its coloring. Also included are a list of embedded equitable (s,p) edge colorings for each K_n. This is currently only in the case where s=p+1 but future plans are to extend it to the other case where s=p as well.
